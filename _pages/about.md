# Biography

Hi! I am a 3-year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence in [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I will receive my bachelor degree in 2024. I am supervised by [Prof. Beilun Wang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0105/c23024a257533/pagem.htm) in [Lab Wang](https://xgbxscwx.seu.edu.cn/wang-labsite/). 	

I am among the top 3% ranked students. During my undergraduate studies, I explored various research directions in the field of AI and undertook numerous projects under the guidance of my professors. The details of some of these projects are as follows. Currently, I am deeply interested in the following areas: machine learning, particularly graph-based machine learning; knowledge graphs; natural language processing; and computer vision.

Now, I am actively seeking professors who align with my areas of interest and would appreciate the opportunity to receive their guidance as I pursue further studies. If you find my profile intriguing, please feel free to reach out to me via email. You can find my email address in the left sidebar.
