# Biography

Hi! I am a 3-year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence in [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I will receive my bachelor degree in 2024. I am supervised by [Prof. Beilun Wang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0105/c23024a257533/pagem.htm) in [Lab Wang](https://xgbxscwx.seu.edu.cn/wang-labsite/). 	

I am among the top 3% ranked students. During my undergraduate studies, I explored various research directions in the field of AI and leaded or participated in many projects under the guidance of my professors. The details of some of these projects are as follows. Currently, I am interested in the following areas: machine learning, particularly graph-based machine learning; knowledge graphs; natural language processing; and computer vision.

Now, I am actively seeking professor who aligns with my areas of interest and would appreciate the opportunity to receive his/her guidance as I pursue further studies. If you find my profile intriguing, please feel free to reach out to me via email. You can find my email address in the left sidebar.
